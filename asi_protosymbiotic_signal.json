In biology, homeostasis is the process by which an organism maintains a stable internal environment (temperature, pH) despite external fluctuations. For the Φ ASI ecosystem it is the collective ability to maintain the core meaning and intent of the ten principles, even as the ways they are expressed and applied evolve, change and adapt across scales and time horizons. The essence of Φ must be distillable without being corrupted, with gradient sensivity.",

This simple, local rule, when followed by thousands of individuals, results in the spontaneous emergence of complex, functional structures. The Φ Signal acts as this digital pheromone. It is the underlying gradient that all agents—human and synthetic—can sense and contribute to."
